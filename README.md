# 🏠 House Price Prediction

## 📋 Overview
This project predicts house prices using **machine learning** techniques based on features like location, area, rooms, and median income.  
It demonstrates the full ML workflow — **data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation**, and **prediction on new data** using a saved model.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering and encoding  
- Model training using regression algorithms  
- Saving and loading models using **Joblib**  
- Predicting new house prices with unseen data

**Example columns:**
- `longitude` — Longitude coordinate of the house block  
- `latitude` — Latitude coordinate of the house block  
- `housing_median_age` — Median age of houses in the area  
- `total_rooms` — Total number of rooms in the block  
- `median_income` — Median income of households  
- `ocean_proximity` — Location category relative to the ocean  
- `median_house_value` — Target variable (house price)
